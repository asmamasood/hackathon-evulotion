# Backend Skills Index

## Overview
This directory contains specialized skills for implementing FastAPI backend systems. Each skill addresses a specific aspect of backend development.

## Available Skills

### 1. FastAPI Routing (`routing.md`)
Design and implement efficient FastAPI routing with proper request/response handling.

### 2. Authentication Integration (`authentication-integration.md`)
Integrate secure authentication and authorization mechanisms with FastAPI endpoints.

### 3. Database Integration (`database-integration.md`)
Manage database interactions with FastAPI, including schema design, operations, and migrations.

### 4. Error Handling (`error-handling.md`)
Implement comprehensive error handling for FastAPI applications.

## Best Practices
- Always follow FastAPI conventions and best practices
- Implement security-first approach for all endpoints
- Use asynchronous operations where appropriate for performance
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Include comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Integration Guidelines
- Each skill can be implemented independently
- Skills should work together to form a complete backend system
- Follow consistent error handling across all skills
- Maintain detailed documentation for each implementation
- Include comprehensive tests for all backend functionality
